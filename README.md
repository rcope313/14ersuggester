# 14erSuggesterüèî

##Project Description
This command-line application lets users search and filter through Colorado‚Äôs 14‚Äôer routes
and can recommend filtered routes based on current mountain weather.

##Design Principles
Currently, this application supports three subcommands (as referenced in greater detail in **Using 14erSuggester**).
14erSuggester scrapes 14‚Äôer route and trailhead data from 
[14ers.com](https://www.14ers.com/); each subcommand communicates with a dao to interface with the local database.

This application also scrapes weather forecast data from [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/); while not stored, 
it‚Äôs used to build on 14erSuggester‚Äôs route-recommendation model. 
The route-recommendation model assesses the interaction between mountain weather 
and filtered 14‚Äôer routes, significantly prioritizing probability of precipitation,
wind-chill, consequence severity of the 14‚Äôer routes, and other qualifiers.

##Using 14erSuggester
14erSuggest supports three subcommands: ```search```, ```compare```, and ```suggest```.
- Jar File: hikesuggesterCli/target/14erSuggesterCli.jar
- Command: ```java -jar <pathToJar> <subcommand>```


###```search```
The ```search``` subcommand supports 20 filter types (see search and  suggest optional 
queries for names and descriptions of each) and coherently outputs the respective rows
from the local database.

###```compare```
The ```compare``` subcommand legigably denotes the difference between two 14‚Äôer routes.
The two 14‚Äôer routes are distinguished by their route names and mountain names 
respectively, or can be distinguished by their 14‚Äôers.com url. Compare subcommand 
will prioritize fetching data by the urls if all information is given.

###```suggest```
The ```suggest``` subcommand is similar mechanically to the search subcommand; 
however, it suggests to the user up to five 14‚Äôer routes according to 
relevant mountain forecast data and user-given filters.

Like all bash scripts, picocli supports multiple single-character flags. 
As an example, ```-sm``` fetches rows of the specified mountain names and 
that are standard routes only.

| 14'er Route Urls | -u, --url          | Rather than entering in two separate Route and Mountain Names, enter two 14'er route urls to compare. |

##Looking Ahead
Currently, 14‚Äôer route and trailhead data exclusively live in a
localized database; future iterations of 14erSuggester would host data 
centrally, and it would interface with a web application rather than by 
the command line for better transportability.
