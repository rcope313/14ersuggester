# 14erSuggesterüèî

## Project Description
This Java command-line application lets users search through Colorado‚Äôs 14‚Äôer routes and can recommend routes based
on current weather and filters.

## Design Principles
14erSuggester scrapes various [14ers.com](https://www.14ers.com/) DOMs for route and trailhead data
and supports three subcommands (as referenced in greater detail in
**Using 14erSuggester**), each of which accesses route data stored
locally with MySQL
.

This application also scrapes weather forecast data from [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/) 
for 14erSuggester‚Äôs route-recommendation model. 
The model assesses the interaction between weather and user-defined filters, significantly
prioritizing probability of precipitation, wind-chill, and consequence severity of the
14‚Äôer routes.

## Using 14erSuggester
14erSuggester supports three subcommands: ```search```, ```compare```, and ```suggest```.
- Jar File: hikesuggesterCli/target/14erSuggesterCli.jar
- Command: ```java -jar <pathToJar> <subcommand>```


### ```search```
The ```search``` subcommand supports 20 filter types (see **``search`` and ``suggest`` optional 
queries** for names and descriptions of each filter) and neatly outputs the respective rows
from the local database.

### ```compare```
The ```compare``` subcommand displays differences between two user-given 14‚Äôer routes.
The user can select the 14'er routes by the supplying the 14‚Äôers.com urls or the route
& mountain names of the two 14'er routes.

### ```suggest```
The ```suggest``` subcommand is similar mechanically to the ``search`` subcommand; 
however, it suggests up to  five 14‚Äôer routes according to 
mountain forecast data and filters.

Like all bash scripts, picocli supports multiple single-character flags. 
As an example, ```-sm``` fetches table rows of the given mountain names and 
that are standard routes only.

| 14'er Route Urls | -u, --url          | Rather than entering in two separate Route and Mountain Names, enter two 14'er route urls to compare. |

## Looking Ahead
Currently, 14‚Äôer route and trailhead data live exclusively in a
local database; future iterations of 14erSuggester would have data available
centrally. It would also interface with a web application rather than by 
the command line for better transportability.
